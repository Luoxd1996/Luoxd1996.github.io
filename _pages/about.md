# About me
<!--* Now, I am a research assistant at West China Hospital of Sichuan University for clinically target volume delineation tool development. I graduated from the School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), co-advised by Prof. [Guotai Wang](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Z2sFN4EAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Shaoting Zhang](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=oiBMWK4AAAAJ&hl=en).
* I am a researcher focused on medical image analysis, particularly in data-efficient learning for medical image computing, such as semi-supervised learning, weakly-supervised learning and human-in-the-loop, and extending them for practical clinical applications. -->
* I am a research assistant at West China Hospital of Sichuan University for developing clinical target volume delineation tools for oncology radiation therapy, working with Prof.[Kang Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ww6adYYAAAAJ&hl=en).
* I received PhD and Bachelor's Degrees in the School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2024 and 2018 respectively.
<!--** , co-advised by Prof. [Guotai Wang](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Z2sFN4EAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Shaoting Zhang](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=oiBMWK4AAAAJ&hl=en). -->
<!-- * <font color="red">I am looking for collaborators on AI for oncology radiotherapy (OARs, GTV and CTV delineation; prognosis prediction, etc.). We have collected several large-scale datasets to develop AI models and research benchmarks (more than 3000 patients with ~ 80 organ/tissue/tumor and clinical information from multi-center have been collected and annotated manually). If you are interested, please don't hesitate to contact me.</font> -->
<!--* Now, I am seeking a research internship position about medical image segmentation during 2021.06-2021.10, feel free to contact me! [[My CV](https://github.com/Luoxd1996/Luoxd1996.github.io/blob/master/files/xiangdeluo_cv.pdf)]-->
